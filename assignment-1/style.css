/* The reason I have chosen this palette is because I wanted to keep the same minimalistic and modern look as the main theme color for my page, in responding to Kim's portfolio.
However, I did not want to pursue the same black and white look as I wanted to personalize it abit to my preference, which is to make it more colorful. */

/* For this website, I have decided to go through with this particular grid system incorporated design template, because I wanted to work directly with the portfolio that I'm responding to. 
This means that I wanted to try and recreate, or at least learn from MyeongAe Kim's portfolio design and give my answers to the prompt through a similar layout.
The dominant element that I have attempted to keep is the grid system that Kim have used, to frame my questions and answers around it, as well as other pictures or icons. */

/* I also regret that I was unable to customize the texts to be more readable, I understand my layout is quite hard to read but it is my best attempt to recreate Kim's site. 
I have chosen the font helvetica beacuse I wanted to keep the simple look just as Kim does with her portfolio. */
